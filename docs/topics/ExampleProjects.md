Example applications are provided in the [examples](https://github.com/FancySafeBot/fsb-library/tree/main/examples) directory of the FSB repository. These examples are designed to demonstrate the use of the FSB API and provide a starting point for developers looking to build their own applications.

Standalone applications will be provided as separate repositories on GitHub at [github.com/FancySafeBot](https://github.com/FancySafeBot).
