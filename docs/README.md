# Fancy Safe Bot Library

A gentle but powerful robotics library for embedded safety-critical applications.

Everyone is talking about how scary the robot uprising will be when the singularity arrives but what we really should be worried about is plain old functional safety. How do you guarantee an assistive exoskeleton won't rip your legs apart? Or that a surgical robot won't jab into your heart during surgery? Well it turns out a lot of people have been very scared about robots causing injuries for a long time now, decades even. There are international standards and guidelines for certifying robots as safe for use under many applications.

Despite having a lot of standards and tools at our disposal, it's very rare to find an open-source library adhering to coding standards and best practices. This library is an attempt to provide code that can be incorporated into safety-critical applications. It's not easy and there's a lot more to safety than choosing the right software library, but it can help! If you're interested in developing for robots that need to be designed and built according to strict safety guidelines, then Fancy Safe Bot is for you!
